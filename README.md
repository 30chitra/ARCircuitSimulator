AR AND P SPICE CIRCUIT SIMULATOR

Approach to the Solution:
We aimed to create  an environment that will enable user to interact with 3D model as if they were real objects.

Description of the Solution:
We first pointed out the problem that we as engineering students were facing of not being able to receive the practical education that we were supposed to.
Plan was to create an environment with the help of AR to solve this problem.

We are creating an interactive system for the user to get in touch with other users while performing experiments virtually.
We are creating a 3D alternative that will give the user the real experience with virtual models. 


Novelty of the Solution:
Our idea is one of its kind. There is no such product in the present market that has an implementation like ours. And that too using the AR/VR technology our application will provide quality interaction with the 3D model that the user will be working on. It is no less than working with real circuit components.

As well as we are providing an user friendly interactive platform through which users can interact with each other. It is basically like our classrooms in real world.


Social Impact:
It will help students with poor financial background who cannot afford to go to schools or colleges. This will help students understand their practicals even in online classes. For the students like us whose education have been compromised due to this pandemic will no longer lack the practical knowledge using this application.

With growing AR technology our product will be very useful to accomplish many targets in the education field to teach students virtually with the help of interactive 3D models just like in real world labs.
Recently Jio has launched Jio glasses in which we can implement our application.
