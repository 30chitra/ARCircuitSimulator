AR AND P SPICE CIRCUIT SIMULATOR

Approach to the Solution:
We aimed to create  an environment that will enable user to interact with 3D model as if they were real objects.

Description of the Solution:
We first pointed out the problem that we as engineering students were facing of not being able to receive the practical education that we were supposed to.
Plan was to create an environment with the help of AR to solve this problem.

We are creating an interactive system for the user to get in touch with other users while performing experiments virtually.
We are creating a 3D alternative that will give the user the real experience with virtual models.
